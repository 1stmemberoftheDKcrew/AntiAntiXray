# AntiAntiXray
For the annoying server owners that add an anti xray plugin.

## Notice
For every plugin dev reading this, you basically cant fix this unless you want everyone on the server to gain riches off fake blocks that suddently become real ;)

## Usage
To scan nearby blocks in selected radius, press `Y` ingame.

To remove a block for testing, creating a ghost block, press `V` ingame.

2. Put it into your mods folder in your fabric installation
3. Enjoy

## Building
MAC: open terminal, cd into some folder, git clone or whatever it is nowadays (rename the jar in the builds folder), drag gradlew to terminal (dont execute yet) then type "build" and hit enter
